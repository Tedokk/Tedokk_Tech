                <p>FreeCodeCamp is a phenomenal free website. There‚Äôs a ton of topics to study about programming. One of the pros of the site is that you get hands-on with code right from the start. You learn to program by coding right away. It‚Äôs helping me a lot because when you write code, there are no shortcuts, so this helps me memorize every tag better.</p>

                <h1>üìå Biography</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="wp-bio">After years of working as a laborer, I decided to make a radical change in my life, pursuing a dream I‚Äôve cherished since I was a child: becoming a web programmer. <br><br>
                     As a kid, when I received my first computer (still without internet), I was captivated by the digital world and imagined creating something of my own. Unfortunately, financial difficulties forced me to leave school early and start working, putting my aspirations on hold. However, that dream never left me. <br><br>
                    Today, with determination, I‚Äôve chosen to invest in myself and start anew by studying programming and dedicating myself every day to building my future. I‚Äôm passionately diving into every language and concept, striving to make the most of every available resource. This isn‚Äôt just a personal challenge; I want to prove to myself and to those I love that change is possible, even when the odds are against you. <br><br>
                    This journey isn‚Äôt just for me but also for my girlfriend and my family, who are my greatest source of strength and motivation. I am determined to turn this dream into reality with sacrifice and dedication because I firmly believe that success comes to those who have the courage to chase their dreams and work hard to make them happen.
