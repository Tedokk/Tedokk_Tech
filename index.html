                <h1>📌 Biography</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="wp-bio">After years of working as a laborer, I decided to make a radical change in my life, pursuing a dream I’ve cherished since I was a child: becoming a web programmer. <br><br>
                     As a kid, when I received my first computer (still without internet), I was captivated by the digital world and imagined creating something of my own. Unfortunately, financial difficulties forced me to leave school early and start working, putting my aspirations on hold. However, that dream never left me. <br><br>
                    Today, with determination, I’ve chosen to invest in myself and start anew by studying programming and dedicating myself every day to building my future. I’m passionately diving into every language and concept, striving to make the most of every available resource. This isn’t just a personal challenge; I want to prove to myself and to those I love that change is possible, even when the odds are against you. <br><br>
                    This journey isn’t just for me but also for my girlfriend and my family, who are my greatest source of strength and motivation. I am determined to turn this dream into reality with sacrifice and dedication because I firmly believe that success comes to those who have the courage to chase their dreams and work hard to make them happen.
